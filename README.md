NotThatUselessProjectReport
===========================
The idea of this plugin is generate a text file with some info about the current open folder or project. By some info I mean the total of files the folder has, the types of files and how much lines of code each type have. It doesn't read binary files, they are totally ignored by the plugin.

I know it is not the most useful information you can have about your project, but I is something cool to know. At least I think it is cool.

I hope you you find this plugin helpful.
